Riot/Matrix room: [#mycete:tapenet.org](https://riot.im/app/#/room/#mycete:tapenet.org)

A [matrix.org](https://matrix.org) micro-blogging (twitter,mastodon) connector.

`mycete` pipes your chat messages from matrix to twitter and/or mastodon. It does this by
listening in on a channel you create. Everything you enter in the channel will be published
to your various feeds!

Optionaly, only stuff you prepend with a ''guard_prefix'' will be published. Obviously the prefix will be removed first.

Delete tweets and toots you posted by redacting the corresponding matrix message.

If you upload images to the controlling matrix room, they will be appended to your next toot and tweet.

Tweets and Toots may be favoured or reblogged / retweeted by using the `reblog_cmd` or `favourite_cmd` (specified in the `[matrix]` section) followed by the status URL or ID

## Example Information Flow

## from Mastodon back to Matrix

`mycete` will also (optinally) inform you about toots that did not originate from `mycete` as well as when someone favourites or reblogs your status and when someone follows you.

The controlling settings are `show_mastodon_notifications`, `show_own_toots_from_foreign_clients` and 
`show_complete_home_stream` in `[matrix]`

If you don't need this, just remove the `feed2matrix` section.

Additionally it is possible to mirror your complete homestream or just part of it to other matrix rooms.
For each room you may filter by tag, post visibility, sensitivity, weather it is an original toot or a reblog, weather our account posted it or someone else and weather or not we are following the author.

To do this, create a separate configuration section for each room named `feed2morerooms_xxxxx` where xxxxx is your name for that configuration. You can specify arbitrary many configurations, as only the ones listed in `[feed2morerooms]configurations` are activated and used.

In addition to the home stream, it is possible to subscribe tag streams using `[feed2morerooms]subscribe_tagstreams` which will be mixed together with the homestream into one big stream which your configurations (s.a.) will then filter.

If you don't need this, just leave `configurations` empty or remove all `feed2morerooms` sections.

## Creating a Matrix room

1. create an account for the bot
2. create an *unencrypted* room with your personal account
3. put the room's address in the config file
4. start the bot
5. invite the bot into the room!



Note that it should be possible to have the bot create the room, but for yet unknown reasons, this will lead to the matrix server not informing the bot about room messages. e.g. it wont't see what you type.


## Linking to Mastodon

When logged into your Mastodon Account in your web browser, go to "Settings", then "Development", then "Your Applications". Create a New Application and give it the required permissions. Put `Client key`, `Client secret` and `Your access token` the tokens into your 'mycete' configuration.

### required permissions
read:accounts read:blocks read:favourites read:filters read:follows read:lists read:mutes read:notifications read:search read:statuses write:conversations write:favourites write:filters write:media write:statuses push

## Linking to Twitter

Oauth via console pin. (TODO)

## TODO

- [X] TravisCI.
- [X] Read the timelines back into the matrix room.
- [X] favorite and reblog Mastodon status
- [X] un-reblog and un-favourite when redacting matrix message
- [ ] tests
- [ ] Error early if our service is enabled and we have invalid credentials. (See if there is API for testing?)
- [X] post images
- [X] support uploading multiple images per Toot/Tweet
- [X] more feedback and user error guards
- [X] use constrained memory, not slowly ever growing maps. Aka don't be a memory hog
- [ ] better support for non-local mastodon servers (display if someone from another server favorites a post in matrix channel, boost non-local posts, etc)
- [ ] look into support for small videos
- [ ] clean up matrixbot.go prefix parser code
- [ ] find a way to boost/replyto/favourite remote Toots (requires translation of URL to local Mastodon instance's status ID). In the meantime we add a "reply using this" URL in the room
- [ ] make showing images in Matrix rooms optional for each additional room
- [ ] reply to a Tweet/Toot DM/comment via Matrix reply-function
- [ ] edit a Toot via Matrix edit-message
- [ ] add command to clear all user-uploaded images. Useful when bot warns about prepared images but they are so far back, you can't find them anymore.
- [ ] support toot scheduling
- [ ] have the bot reply to last image still in queue when bot warns about old images still in queue.
- [x] support image descriptions for increase reader-accessibility
  - [x] support setting image descriptions on social media end
  - [x] save image description somewhere for posting step
  - [x] create first user-interface in matrix channel to describe images. (e.g. reply to an img with desc)
  - [x] as second user-interface in matrix channel to describe images, copy media-caption/image-alt-text from matrix
- [ ] remove Twitter (X) support, as third-party clients are obviously not welcome any more.
- [ ] look into what would be needed to add BlueSky
- [ ] move to better config file parser
